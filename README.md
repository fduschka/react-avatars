# React-Avatars

React-Avatars makes it possible to generate endless different avatars.

## Installation

The best way to consume React-Avatars is via the npm package which you can install with npm.

```sh
npm i react-avatars
```

## Importing Components

```js
import { Avatar } from 'react-avatars'
```

## Examples
### Random Avatar
```js
<Avatar /> 
```
### Customized Avatar
If you don't want a new avatar each time your application renders, you can provide a seed which generates an avatar based on your seed.
```js
<Avatar seed={'your_seed'} size="50" bg="#FF6347" />
```
## Styles
We are constantly workin on adding more styles!
